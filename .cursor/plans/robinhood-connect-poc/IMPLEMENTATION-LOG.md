# Robinhood Connect Offramp Implementation Log

## Template for Implementation Progress Tracking

This file serves as a template for tracking implementation progress. Each sub-plan implementation should add a new section documenting changes, testing, and outcomes.

---

## Implementation Format

Each implementation session should follow this format:

````markdown
## Date: [YYYY-MM-DD]

## Branch: `[branch-name]`

## Sub-Plan: [Sub-Plan X - Title]

---

## Summary

## Example Implementation Entry

## Date: January 15, 2025

## Branch: `robinhood-offramp-setup`

## Sub-Plan: Sub-Plan 1 - Project Setup & Architecture

---

## Summary

Successfully forked the coinbase-oauth directory to create robinhood-offramp foundation. As a result of these changes, the project now has a clean foundation for Robinhood Connect integration with all Coinbase-specific code removed and proper environment variable setup for Robinhood API keys.

---

## Files Modified/Created

### `robinhood-offramp/.env.local`

**Key Changes:**
- Added ROBINHOOD_APP_ID environment variable
- Added ROBINHOOD_API_KEY environment variable
- Removed COINBASE_CLIENT_ID and COINBASE_CLIENT_SECRET
- Kept NEXTAUTH_URL and NEXTAUTH_SECRET for gradual migration

### `robinhood-offramp/package.json`

**Key Changes:**
- Added uuid dependency for referenceId generation
- Updated project name to "robinhood-offramp"
- Kept existing dependencies (Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind)

### `robinhood-offramp/types/robinhood.d.ts`

**Key Changes:**
- Created TypeScript definitions for Robinhood API responses
- Defined OfframpParams, DepositAddressResponse, OrderStatusResponse interfaces
- Added CallbackParams interface for redirect handling

---

## Testing Performed

### Manual Testing
- [x] Project builds successfully with `npm run build`
- [x] Development server starts with `npm run dev`
- [x] Environment variables load correctly
- [x] TypeScript compilation passes without errors

### Integration Testing
- [x] Existing UI components still work
- [x] Tailwind CSS styles apply correctly
- [x] No broken imports or missing dependencies

---

## Issues Encountered

### Issue 1: NextAuth Dependency Conflicts
**Problem:** Removing NextAuth immediately broke several components that imported useSession
**Solution:** Kept NextAuth temporarily, will remove in Sub-Plan 6 when dashboard is rebuilt
**Impact:** Gradual migration approach reduces risk of breaking changes

---

## Next Steps

1. Implement deposit address redemption API (Sub-Plan 2)
2. Create offramp URL generation utilities (Sub-Plan 3)
3. Begin callback handling implementation (Sub-Plan 4)

---

## Notes

- Environment variables must be added to production deployment
- UUID library chosen over crypto.randomUUID for broader compatibility
- Existing shadcn/ui components can be reused without modification
- TypeScript strict mode enabled for better type safety

---

*This template should be followed for each sub-plan implementation to maintain consistent documentation and enable easy progress tracking.*
