Hi [Name],

We need Coinbase Prime deposit addresses for additional networks in our Robinhood
offramp integration:

EVM Networks (need unique address for each):

Each address needs automated liquidation configured.

Thanks!
```

### 2. Update Configuration

```typescript
// Replace these placeholders:
ARBITRUM: 'PLACEHOLDER_CB_PRIME_ARBITRUM'  ‚Üí Your CB Prime Arbitrum address
BASE: 'PLACEHOLDER_CB_PRIME_BASE'          ‚Üí Your CB Prime Base address

```

## Important Notes

### EVM Address Requirements

**Each EVM network MUST have its own unique address** for CB Prime's automated liquidation:

- ‚úÖ Ethereum: `0x8e58...8113` (different address)
- ‚úÖ Polygon: `0x3F5a...3d66` (different address)
- ‚è≥ Arbitrum: Need unique address
- ‚è≥ Base: Need unique address
- ‚è≥ Optimism: Need unique address
- ‚è≥ Zora: Need unique address
- ‚úÖ Avalanche: `0x7e70...2385` (different address)
- ‚úÖ ETC: `0x6Eca...3d37` (different address)

**Why?** CB Prime's automated liquidation infrastructure tracks and settles each network separately.

### Networks That Can Share Addresses

**None.** Each network needs its own unique address for proper tracking and automated liquidation in CB Prime.

## Current Configuration File

**File**: `robinhood-offramp/lib/network-addresses.ts`

**Status**:

- ‚úÖ 11 networks fully configured
- ‚è≥ 9 items waiting for CB Prime

**Next Step**: Request the 9 missing items from your CB Prime team

---

## Timeline

**Estimated**: 3-5 business days to receive addresses from CB Prime  
**Then**: 30 minutes to update configuration and test  
**Total**: Ready to launch within 1 week

## Questions?

All the complex documentation has been removed. This is straightforward:

1. You already have most CB Prime addresses ‚úÖ
2. Just need 9 more items from CB Prime team
3. Update the placeholders in `network-addresses.ts`
4. Test and deploy

That's it! üöÄ
