# Critical URL Fix: SP4 & SP8 Base URL Corrections

**Date**: 2025-10-25 11:54
**Severity**: üî¥ CRITICAL
**Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED
**Affected Sub-Plans**: SP4 (Robinhood Client Service), SP8 (Test Infrastructure)

## Issue Description

During verification against the official Robinhood Connect SDK documentation, we discovered that the base URLs used in our refactored services were **INCORRECT**.

### Root Cause

The base URL `https://trading.robinhood.com` was used instead of the correct `https://api.robinhood.com` as specified in the Robinhood Connect SDK documentation.

This appears to have been a misunderstanding during the initial refactoring, possibly confusing the trading platform URL with the API endpoint URL.

## Affected Files

### 1. RobinhoodClientService (SP4)
**File**: `lib/robinhood/services/robinhood-client.service.ts`

**Incorrect** (Line 73):
```typescript
baseUrl: config.baseUrl || 'https://trading.robinhood.com',
```

**Correct**:
```typescript
baseUrl: config.baseUrl || 'https://api.robinhood.com',
```

**Impact**:
- ‚ùå Service would have failed to make API calls (404 or network errors)
- ‚ùå ConnectId generation would fail
- ‚ùå Asset discovery would fail
- ‚úÖ **However**, the working POC route was using the correct URL directly, so POC functionality was NOT affected

### 2. Test Infrastructure Nock Mocks (SP8)
**File**: `__tests__/mocks/robinhood-nock-api.ts`

**Incorrect** (Line 6):
```typescript
const ROBINHOOD_BASE_URL = 'https://trading.robinhood.com'
```

**Correct**:
```typescript
const ROBINHOOD_BASE_URL = 'https://api.robinhood.com'
```

**Impact**:
- ‚ùå Nock interceptors would NOT intercept actual API calls
- ‚ùå Tests would make real network requests (or fail)
- ‚ùå Tests would not properly mock Robinhood APIs

## SDK Documentation Reference

From `Robinhood_Connect_SDK_Combined.md`:

**ConnectId Endpoint** (Line 79):
```
Base URL - POST: https://api.robinhood.com/catpay/v1/connect_id/
```

**Discovery Endpoint** (Line 156):
```
Base URL: https://api.robinhood.com/catpay/v1/supported_currencies/
```

**Onramp URL** (Line 124):
```
Base URL: https://applink.robinhood.com/u/connect
```

## Verification Performed

### 1. Checked SDK Documentation
- ‚úÖ Confirmed all API endpoints use `https://api.robinhood.com`
- ‚úÖ No endpoints use `https://trading.robinhood.com`

### 2. Checked Working POC Code
- ‚úÖ Existing `generate-onramp-url/route.ts` uses correct URL: `https://api.robinhood.com/catpay/v1/connect_id/`
- ‚úÖ Existing `discovery.ts` uses correct URL: `https://api.robinhood.com/catpay/v1/supported_currencies/`

### 3. Other URLs Not Changed
**URL Builder Service** (`url-builder.service.ts`):
- Uses `https://robinhood.com/connect/amount` (Daffy-style)
- This is an **intentional deviation** from SDK's `https://applink.robinhood.com/u/connect`
- Not changed as part of this fix (requires separate decision)

## Resolution

### Changes Applied

1. **RobinhoodClientService** (line 73):
   - Changed base URL from `https://trading.robinhood.com` to `https://api.robinhood.com`

2. **Nock Mocks** (line 8):
   - Changed base URL from `https://trading.robinhood.com` to `https://api.robinhood.com`

### Validation After Fix

**Tests**: ‚úÖ PASS
```bash
npm test
# 2 test suites passed
# 7 tests passed
# 0 failures
```

**Linter**: ‚úÖ PASS
```bash
# No linter errors in affected files
```

**TypeScript**: ‚úÖ PASS
```bash
# No TypeScript errors
```

## Why This Wasn't Caught Earlier

1. **Tests not yet comprehensive**: SP8 just set up infrastructure, SP9 will add comprehensive tests
2. **No integration testing yet**: Services haven't been wired to API routes yet (SP10-11)
3. **POC route worked**: The original POC code had the correct URL, so functionality wasn't broken
4. **No real API calls in tests yet**: Nock mocks weren't actually being used against real patterns

## Prevention for Future

### Immediate (SP9)
- ‚úÖ Add tests that verify correct API endpoint URLs
- ‚úÖ Add tests that verify nock mocks intercept correctly
- ‚úÖ Test actual service methods against mocked APIs

### Future Sub-Plans
- Validate all URLs against SDK documentation
- Add URL validation tests
- Cross-reference implementation with SDK docs in validation steps

## Impact Assessment

### Before Fix
- üî¥ **CRITICAL**: Services would fail in production
- üî¥ **CRITICAL**: Tests would not properly mock APIs
- üü¢ **NO IMPACT**: POC still worked (uses old routes with correct URLs)

### After Fix
- ‚úÖ Services now use correct API endpoints
- ‚úÖ Tests will properly intercept API calls
- ‚úÖ Ready for comprehensive testing in SP9
- ‚úÖ Ready for integration in SP10-11

## Files Modified

**Modified**:
1. `lib/robinhood/services/robinhood-client.service.ts` (1 line changed)
2. `__tests__/mocks/robinhood-nock-api.ts` (1 line changed)

**Not Modified** (Intentionally):
1. `lib/robinhood/services/url-builder.service.ts` (Daffy-style URL is intentional)
2. `lib/robinhood/assets/discovery.ts` (Already correct)
3. `app/api/robinhood/generate-onramp-url/route.ts` (Already correct)

## Lessons Learned

1. **Always verify against official documentation**: Don't assume, always check SDK docs
2. **Test URLs explicitly**: Add tests that verify correct endpoints are being called
3. **Cross-reference working code**: Check existing working implementations for patterns
4. **Document deviations**: When intentionally deviating from docs, document why

- **SP8 Completion Log**: `20251025-1151-SP8-COMPLETE.md`

## Status

‚úÖ **RESOLVED** - Both services now use correct base URLs matching official Robinhood Connect SDK documentation.
