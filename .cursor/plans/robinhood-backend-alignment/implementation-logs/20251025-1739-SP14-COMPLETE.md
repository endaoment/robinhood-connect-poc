### 6. Architectural Decisions (ARCHITECTURE.md)

All 7 major decisions documented:

1. **Database Persistence Strategy** - Use CryptoDonationPledge
2. **Implementation Scope** - Refactor POC only
3. **Backend API Integration** - Mock with toasts
4. **Test Mocking Strategy** - Use nock
5. **Object Parameter Pattern** - 3+ arguments
6. **Directory Structure Alignment** - Full NestJS structure
7. **Frontend/Backend Separation** - Complete separation

Plus design decisions from testing (asset pre-selection, no polling, etc.)

### 7. Flow Diagrams (FLOW-DIAGRAMS.md)

Simplified and updated flow diagrams:

**Removed Outdated Content**:
- ❌ "Offramp" references (onramp only)
- ❌ Order status polling diagrams (removed feature)
- ❌ Redemption address API (never used)
- ❌ Old architecture without service layer
- ❌ 3 excessive/duplicate diagrams

**Created 5 Focused Diagrams**:
1. **High-Level User Flow** - End-to-end user experience
2. **Service Layer Architecture** - Shows libs/ structure and all services
3. **Detailed Sequence Diagram** - Service interactions with proper APIs
4. **Backend Migration Flow** - Visual guide for 2-hour migration
5. **Data Flow - Pledge Creation** - Complete CryptoDonationPledge field mapping

**Key Updates**:
- Reflects backend-aligned architecture (service layer, DTOs)
- Shows NestJS module/controller structure
- Visualizes POC vs Production separation
- Illustrates migration path clearly
- Fixed Mermaid syntax errors (quoted forward slashes in paths)
