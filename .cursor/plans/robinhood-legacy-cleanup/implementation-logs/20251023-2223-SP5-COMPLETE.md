# Sub-Plan 5 Implementation Complete

**Date**: October 24, 2025, 17:20
**Duration**: ~40 minutes
**Implementer**: AI Assistant
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE

---

## Summary

Successfully consolidated and reorganized all documentation for the Robinhood Connect onramp integration. Moved all documentation files into the `docs/` folder (except README.md), created new comprehensive guides (ARCHITECTURE.md and TESTING_GUIDE.md), and updated all existing documentation to reflect only the current asset pre-selection implementation.

---

## Steps Completed

- [x] Step 1: Delete CHANGES-ORDER-STATUS-REMOVAL.md (extracted context to ARCHITECTURE.md)
- [x] Step 2: Create ARCHITECTURE.md - comprehensive system architecture documentation
- [x] Step 3: Create TESTING_GUIDE.md - consolidated all testing documentation
- [x] Step 4: Delete API-TESTING.md and CALLBACK-TESTING.md (consolidated)
- [x] Step 5: Move ARCHITECTURE.md, TESTING_GUIDE.md, and LOGGING-GUIDE.md to docs/
- [x] Step 6: Update README.md to reflect current state only
- [x] Step 7: Update docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md (removed deprecated/offramp content)
- [x] Step 8: Update docs/USER_GUIDE.md (current asset pre-selection flow only)
- [x] Step 9: Update docs/FLOW-DIAGRAMS.md (current architecture)
- [x] Step 10: Verify all cross-references and links are correct

---

## Deviations from Plan

**Enhanced Organization**: Per user request, reorganized documentation structure to keep only README.md at root level with all other documentation in the `docs/` folder. This provides better organization and clearer separation between entry point (README) and detailed documentation.

**Files Affected**:

- Moved `ARCHITECTURE.md` ‚Üí `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- Moved `TESTING_GUIDE.md` ‚Üí `docs/TESTING_GUIDE.md`
- Moved `LOGGING-GUIDE.md` ‚Üí `docs/LOGGING-GUIDE.md`
- Updated all cross-references to reflect new paths

---
