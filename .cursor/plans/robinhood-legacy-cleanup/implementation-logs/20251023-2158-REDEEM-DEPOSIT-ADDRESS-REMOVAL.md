# Redeem Deposit Address Endpoint Removal

**Date**: 2024-10-23
**Time**: 21:58
**Type**: Legacy Code Removal
**Related Sub-Plan**: Sub-Plan 2 (Deprecated URL Builders)

## Summary

Removed the unused `/api/robinhood/redeem-deposit-address` API endpoint and its associated `redeemDepositAddress` function from `lib/robinhood-api.ts`. This endpoint was part of the legacy flow where Robinhood would call back to our server to get deposit addresses. With the new SDK-based flow, this endpoint is no longer needed.

## Rationale

The `redeem-deposit-address` endpoint was designed for the legacy Robinhood Connect flow where:

1. User selects an asset in Robinhood's UI
2. Robinhood calls our server with the `referenceId` to get our deposit address
3. We return our wallet address for that asset

With the new SDK flow:

- We specify the deposit address upfront when generating the onramp URL
- Robinhood never needs to call back to us for deposit addresses
- The entire callback mechanism is obsolete

## Files Deleted

### 1. Route Handler

- **Path**: `robinhood-onramp/app/api/robinhood/redeem-deposit-address/route.ts`
- **Size**: 2.5KB, 99 lines
- **Content**: POST endpoint that called `redeemDepositAddress()` function

### 2. API Function Removed

- **File**: `robinhood-onramp/lib/robinhood-api.ts`
- **Function**: `redeemDepositAddress(referenceId: string): Promise<DepositAddressResponse>`
- **Lines Removed**: ~127 lines (lines 27-153)

## Dependencies Preserved

### Type Definition Kept

- `DepositAddressResponse` type definition kept in `types/robinhood.d.ts`
- **Reason**: Still used by `app/callback/page.tsx` for type safety
- **Usage**: `getDepositAddressForAsset()` function returns this type

### Import Kept

- `import type { DepositAddressResponse } from '@/types/robinhood'` kept in `robinhood-api.ts`
- **Reason**: May be needed for future API functions

## Documentation Still Referencing (To Be Updated Later)

The following documentation files still reference the removed endpoint:

1. **robinhood-onramp/docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md**

   - Line 62: Section describing the endpoint
   - Line 188: Flow diagram reference
   - Line 321: cURL example

2. **robinhood-onramp/CALLBACK-TESTING.md**

   - Line 336: API call documentation

3. **robinhood-onramp/API-TESTING.md**

   - Lines 159, 225: cURL examples

4. **robinhood-onramp/README.md**

   - Line 105: File structure listing

5. **robinhood-onramp/LOGGING-GUIDE.md**
   - Line 161: Logging example reference

**Note**: These documentation references will be cleaned up as part of Sub-Plan 5: Documentation Consolidation

## Verification

### Code Search Results

Verified no active code references remain:

```bash
# Search for route references
grep -r "redeem-deposit-address" robinhood-onramp/app
# Result: No matches (endpoint deleted)

grep -r "redeem-deposit-address" robinhood-onramp/lib
# Result: No matches (function deleted)

grep -r "redeem-deposit-address" robinhood-onramp/components
# Result: No matches

# Only documentation references remain (expected)
```

### Type Safety Validation

- âœ… `DepositAddressResponse` still properly typed in `types/robinhood.d.ts`
- âœ… Callback page still compiles with type definition
- âœ… No TypeScript errors introduced

## Impact Assessment

### Breaking Changes

- âœ… **None** - Endpoint was not used in production flow
- âœ… No external dependencies on this endpoint
- âœ… SDK flow doesn't require this endpoint

### Benefits

- ðŸ“¦ Reduced codebase size by ~230 lines
- ðŸ§¹ Removed unused API endpoint
- ðŸ”’ Eliminated unnecessary callback vulnerability surface
- ðŸ“š Clearer separation between legacy and SDK flows

## Related Work

This removal is part of the broader legacy cleanup effort:

- **Sub-Plan 1**: Offramp purge (completed)
- **Sub-Plan 2**: Deprecated URL builders (in progress)
- **Sub-Plan 3**: Feature flag removal (pending)
- **Sub-Plan 4**: ID system consolidation (pending)
- **Sub-Plan 5**: Documentation consolidation (pending)

## Next Steps

- [ ] Continue with Sub-Plan 2: Remove deprecated URL builder functions
- [ ] Update documentation in Sub-Plan 5 to remove references to this endpoint
- [ ] Consider adding migration notes if any external systems reference this endpoint

## Lessons Learned

**Best Practice**: Always verify endpoint usage before removal by:

1. Searching for route references in application code
2. Checking for function calls in TypeScript/JavaScript files
3. Identifying type dependencies
4. Documenting where documentation still references the removed code

**Note**: Keeping type definitions even when removing implementations can be beneficial for:

- Backward compatibility with existing code
- Type safety in related functions
- Future implementation flexibility

**Completion Status**: âœ… COMPLETE
**No Rollback Needed**: Endpoint was never in production use
