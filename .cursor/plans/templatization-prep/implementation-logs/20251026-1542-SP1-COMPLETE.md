## Template Pattern Clarity Test

**Questions (from validation steps):**

1. ✅ Is it obvious this came from a template? **YES** - First line of header states "Based on: blank-poc Template"
2. ✅ Can you find template documentation? **YES** - TEMPLATE-USAGE.md linked in multiple places
3. ✅ Is implementation directory clear? **YES** - Directory structure shows root vs robinhood-onramp/ clearly
4. ✅ Is professional appearance maintained? **YES** - Clean formatting, emojis used appropriately, clear hierarchy

**Time to Understanding**: < 30 seconds to identify template pattern

## Consistency Check

- ✅ "blank-poc" consistently referenced throughout
- ✅ "robinhood-onramp/" directory name consistent in all references
- ✅ Template pattern language consistent across sections
- ✅ Professional tone maintained throughout
- ✅ No overuse of "template" - balanced and natural

## Known Issues

None

## Next Steps

- [x] Review this completion log
- [ ] Proceed to Sub-Plan 2: Root QUICK-START - Implementation Focus
- [ ] Maintain template language consistency established here
- [ ] Build on template-aware foundation

## Time Breakdown

- Context review: 5 minutes
- Implementation: 15 minutes
