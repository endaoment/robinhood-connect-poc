# Sub-Plan 6 Implementation Complete

**Date**: 2025-10-26 15:55  
**Duration**: 15 minutes  
**Implementer**: AI Agent  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

---

## Summary

Successfully updated `robinhood-onramp/docs/STRUCTURE.md` to be template-aware while preserving all technical details. The document now clearly shows the two-level structure (root template context + implementation directory) and identifies which parts came from the template vs implementation-specific customizations.

---

## Steps Completed

- [x] Step 1: Update Header Section - Template origin and two-level structure overview
- [x] Step 2: Add Template Context to Directory Layout - Annotations showing template vs custom
- [x] Step 3: Update "Using This as Template" Section - Reference blank-poc template
- [x] Step 4: Add Template Pattern Section Before "What Goes Where" - Foundation principles
- [x] Step 5: Update Footer/Migration Reference - Enhanced migration with template benefits

---

## Deviations from Plan

None - followed plan exactly as specified in sub-plan-6.
