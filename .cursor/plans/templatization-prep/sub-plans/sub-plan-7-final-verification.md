### Success Criteria from Sub-Plan 0

Reference: `.cursor/plans/templatization-prep/sub-plans/sub-plan-0-drafting-plan.md`

---

## Objectives

1. Verify all Phase 1 documentation changes
2. Test all cross-references and links
3. Ensure template pattern is obvious
4. Check professional appearance
5. Validate consistency across all files
6. Prepare for Phase 2 (fork to blank-poc)

## Precise Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Documentation Flow Verification

**Action**: Read through entire documentation as new user

**Process:**
1. Start at root `README.md`
2. Follow links to `QUICK-START.md`
3. Read `TEMPLATE-USAGE.md`
4. Navigate to `robinhood-onramp/README.md`
5. Explore `robinhood-onramp/docs/`

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Template pattern obvious within 30 seconds of reading root README
- [ ] Clear path from root to implementation docs
- [ ] TEMPLATE-USAGE.md comprehensive and clear
- [ ] Implementation docs clearly Robinhood-specific
- [ ] No confusion about what's template vs implementation
- [ ] Professional tone throughout

**Expected**: Smooth flow, clear purpose at each level

---

### Step 2: Link Verification

**Action**: Test every link in updated documentation

**Root Level Links:**

**In `README.md`:**
```bash
# Template Pattern links
./TEMPLATE-USAGE.md
./QUICK-START.md
https://github.com/endaoment/blank-poc  # (noted as coming soon)

# Implementation links
./robinhood-onramp/README.md

./.cursor/plans/

# All documentation links
./robinhood-onramp/docs/STRUCTURE.md

./robinhood-onramp/docs/MIGRATION-GUIDE.md
```

**In `QUICK-START.md`:**
```bash

### Step 3: Template Pattern Clarity Test

**Action**: Have someone unfamiliar read documentation

**Test Questions:**
1. Can they understand this came from a template?
2. Is blank-poc purpose clear?
3. Can they distinguish template docs from implementation docs?
4. Is the two-level structure obvious?
5. Can they find template usage guide?
6. Do they understand how to create new POC?

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Template origin obvious in < 30 seconds
- [ ] Two-level structure clear
- [ ] TEMPLATE-USAGE.md easy to find
- [ ] Implementation vs template distinction clear
- [ ] blank-poc purpose understood
- [ ] Path to creating new POC clear

**If Any Answer is "No"**: Revisit relevant documentation and clarify

---

### Step 4: Consistency Verification

**Action**: Check consistency across all updated files

**Template Language:**
```bash
# Verify these phrases are used consistently:
grep -r "blank-poc" README.md QUICK-START.md TEMPLATE-USAGE.md robinhood-onramp/
grep -r "template pattern" README.md QUICK-START.md TEMPLATE-USAGE.md robinhood-onramp/
grep -r "robinhood-onramp" README.md QUICK-START.md TEMPLATE-USAGE.md robinhood-onramp/
```

**Checklist:**
- [ ] "blank-poc" consistently referenced
- [ ] "template pattern" consistently described
- [ ] "robinhood-onramp/" directory name consistent
- [ ] "libs/shared/" referenced consistently
- [ ] Professional tone throughout
- [ ] No contradictions between files

---

### Step 5: Professional Appearance Check
