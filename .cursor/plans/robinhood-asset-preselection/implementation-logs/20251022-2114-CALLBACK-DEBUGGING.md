# Callback Flow Debugging - Investigation & Fix

**Date**: October 22, 2025 20:35
**Status**: üîß IN PROGRESS
**Issue**: Callback not being triggered after successful Robinhood transfer

---

## Problem Summary

User reported:

- ‚úÖ Donation **working** - funds hit Coinbase Prime account
- ‚ùå Callback **not working** - nothing appearing in ngrok inspector
- ‚ùå Browser **not redirected** back to /callback page after transfer

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Discovery: Different Callback Flows

The new Daffy-style URL implementation uses a **different callback mechanism** than the old flow:

#### Old Flow (Multi-Network)

```
1. User clicks ‚Üí Generate URL (no wallet address)
2. User selects asset in Robinhood
3. Robinhood calls /api/robinhood/redeem-deposit-address
4. We return wallet address
5. Robinhood completes transfer
6. Robinhood redirects to /callback?assetCode=ETH&assetAmount=0.5&network=ETHEREUM
```

#### New Flow (Daffy-Style with Pre-Selection)

```
1. User selects asset ‚Üí Generate URL (includes wallet address!)
2. User confirms in Robinhood
3. Robinhood completes transfer (already has wallet address)
4. Robinhood redirects to /callback?connectId=xxx (????)
   ‚Üë This is what we needed to verify!
```

### Key Difference

**With asset pre-selection, the wallet address is provided UPFRONT in the URL**, so:

- Robinhood doesn't need to call our API to get the wallet address
- Robinhood might not send the same callback parameters
- The transfer still works because the address was in the initial URL

---

## What We Don't Know Yet

We need to determine what query parameters Robinhood actually sends in the callback with the Daffy-style URL:

**Possibilities:**

1. `connectId` only
2. `depositQuoteId`
3. No redirect at all (transfer completes silently)
4. Different parameters entirely

**The investigation:** We added comprehensive logging to capture ALL query parameters sent to the callback page.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Callback Page Logging

**File**: `robinhood-offramp/app/callback/page.tsx`

Added comprehensive query parameter logging:

```typescript
// Log ALL query parameters for debugging
console.log("üîç [CALLBACK] Received query parameters:");
const allParams: Record<string, string> = {};
searchParams.forEach((value, key) => {
  allParams[key] = value;
  console.log(`  ${key}: ${value}`);
});
console.log("Full params object:", allParams);
```

This will help us see **exactly** what Robinhood sends back.

### 2. localStorage-Based Asset Recovery

**Files**:

- `robinhood-offramp/app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Store asset info before redirect
- `robinhood-offramp/app/callback/page.tsx` - Retrieve asset info on callback

**Dashboard (before redirect):**

```typescript
// Store transfer info in localStorage for callback recovery
localStorage.setItem("robinhood_selected_asset", selection.asset.symbol);
localStorage.setItem("robinhood_selected_network", selection.asset.network);
localStorage.setItem("robinhood_connect_id", result.data.connectId || "");
```

**Callback page (on return):**

```typescript
// Try to recover asset info from localStorage
const storedAsset = localStorage.getItem("robinhood_selected_asset");
const storedNetwork = localStorage.getItem("robinhood_selected_network");
const storedAmount = localStorage.getItem("robinhood_transfer_amount");

if (storedAsset && storedNetwork) {
  // Reconstruct callback params from stored data
  const reconstructedParams = {
    assetCode: storedAsset,
    assetAmount: storedAmount || "Unknown",
    network: storedNetwork,
  };

  // Show success page with reconstructed data
  const depositAddress = getDepositAddressForAsset(reconstructedParams);
  // ... display to user
}
```

### 3. Support for Multiple Callback Formats

The callback page now handles:

- **Old-style callbacks**: `assetCode`, `assetAmount`, `network` query params
- **New-style callbacks**: `connectId`, `depositQuoteId` query params
- **localStorage fallback**: When callback params are missing, use stored data

---

## Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Check if Callback is Being Triggered

**Setup:**

1. Ensure ngrok is running:

   ```bash
   ngrok http 3000
   ```

2. Update `.env.local` with ngrok URL:

   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CALLBACK_URL=https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok-free.dev/callback
   ```

3. Restart dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

**Test Steps:**

1. Open dashboard: http://localhost:3030/dashboard
2. Select an asset (e.g., ETH)
3. Click "Continue to Robinhood"
4. Complete transfer in Robinhood
5. **Watch for:**
   - Browser console logs showing callback parameters
   - ngrok inspector showing incoming request to `/callback`
   - Redirect back to our callback page

**Expected Results:**

**If redirect happens:**

- ‚úÖ You'll see console logs with all query parameters
- ‚úÖ ngrok inspector will show the request
- ‚úÖ We can identify what params Robinhood sends

**If NO redirect:**

- This might be expected behavior (Robinhood doesn't redirect with pre-selected assets)
- The transfer still works (funds arrive) but no callback occurs

### Test 2: Verify localStorage Recovery Works

**If callback DOES happen (even with different params):**

1. Check browser console for:

   ```
   üîç [CALLBACK] Received query parameters:
     connectId: xxx-xxx-xxx
     (or other parameters)

   üì¶ [CALLBACK] Stored transfer info:
     asset: ETH
     network: ETHEREUM

   ‚úÖ [CALLBACK] Reconstructed params from localStorage
   ```

2. Verify the callback page shows:
   - Correct asset name
   - Correct network
   - Correct wallet address
   - Transfer amount (if available)

### Test 3: Check ngrok Traffic Inspector

Visit: http://127.0.0.1:4040/inspect/http

Look for:

- Any requests to `/callback` endpoint
- Query parameters in the request URL
- Timestamp matching your transfer completion

---

## Possible Outcomes

### Outcome A: Callback Happens with Different Params

- ‚úÖ **Good!** We'll see what params Robinhood sends
- **Next step:** Update callback logic to handle those params
- **Evidence:** ngrok shows request, console shows parameters

### Outcome B: No Callback At All

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Expected with pre-selected assets**
- Robinhood already has the wallet address, no need to call back
- **Next step:** Consider the transfer "complete" when Robinhood tab closes
- **Evidence:** ngrok shows no requests after transfer

### Outcome C: Callback to Different URL

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Robinhood might be using a different redirect mechanism
- Check if Robinhood shows a success page with "Return to App" button
- **Evidence:** Manual redirect instead of automatic

---

## Next Steps Based on Findings

### If We Get Callback with Parameters:

1. Document exact parameters Robinhood sends
2. Update callback page to handle those parameters
3. Test with multiple assets to verify consistency
4. Proceed with Sub-Plan 5 comprehensive testing

### If We Get NO Callback:

1. **Option A: User manually returns to app**

   - Add "Return to Dashboard" button/link in Robinhood flow
   - Use localStorage to show "Transfer in Progress" status
   - Poll for transfer completion

2. **Option B: Webhook/Server-side notification**

   - Check Robinhood API for webhook capabilities
   - Implement server-side transfer status polling
   - Notify user via dashboard update

3. **Option C: Accept the limitation**
   - Document that callback doesn't occur with pre-selected assets
   - Show success message: "Your transfer is being processed"
   - User can check their Coinbase Prime account for confirmation

## Questions to Answer

1. ‚úÖ Does the transfer complete successfully? **YES - funds hit Coinbase Prime**
2. ‚ùì Does Robinhood redirect back to our callback URL?
3. ‚ùì If yes, what query parameters does Robinhood send?
4. ‚ùì If no, is there an alternative notification mechanism?
5. ‚ùì How does Daffy handle this with their implementation?
