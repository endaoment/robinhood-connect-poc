# Robinhood Connect Network Fix - Implementation Summary

**Date**: October 22, 2025  
**Issue**: 404 error after authentication due to unsupported networks in Connect URL  
**Status**: ✅ FIXED

## Problem

The Robinhood Connect URL was including 9 unsupported networks, causing a 404 error after successful authentication. Robinhood's API only supports 11 specific networks for the Connect offramp flow.

## Root Cause

Three files were defining or returning all 20 networks instead of just the 11 officially supported ones:

1. TypeScript type definition included all networks
2. URL builder constants included all networks
3. Asset address helper function dynamically generated network list from all assets

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated TypeScript Type Definition

**File**: `robinhood-offramp/types/robinhood.d.ts`

Removed 9 unsupported network types:

- ❌ ARBITRUM
- ❌ BASE
- ❌ CARDANO
- ❌ HEDERA
- ❌ OPTIMISM
- ❌ SUI
- ❌ TONCOIN
- ❌ XRP
- ❌ ZORA

Kept 11 supported networks:

- ✅ AVALANCHE
- ✅ BITCOIN
- ✅ BITCOIN_CASH
- ✅ DOGECOIN
- ✅ ETHEREUM
- ✅ ETHEREUM_CLASSIC
- ✅ LITECOIN
- ✅ POLYGON
- ✅ SOLANA
- ✅ STELLAR
- ✅ TEZOS

### 2. Updated URL Builder Constants

**File**: `robinhood-offramp/lib/robinhood-url-builder.ts`

**Changes**:

- Updated `SUPPORTED_NETWORKS` array to only include 11 networks
- Updated `NETWORK_ASSET_MAP` to remove unsupported network entries
- Added documentation comments referencing Robinhood API confirmation

### 3. Fixed Network List Function

**File**: `robinhood-offramp/lib/robinhood-asset-addresses.ts`

**Changes**:

- Replaced dynamic `getSupportedNetworks()` function with hardcoded list of 11 supported networks
- Removed asset-to-network mapping that was generating unsupported networks
- Added documentation about Robinhood Connect support

### 4. Updated Dashboard Display Logic

**File**: `robinhood-offramp/app/dashboard/page.tsx`

**Changes**:

- Removed network detection for unsupported networks (ARB, OP, ZORA, ADA, SUI, HBAR, XRP)
- Added comments explaining that some assets have addresses but aren't in Connect flow
- Improved POLYGON network detection

## Validation

### Before Fix

```
supportedNetworks=ARBITRUM,AVALANCHE,BASE,BITCOIN,BITCOIN_CASH,CARDANO,DOGECOIN,ETHEREUM,ETHEREUM_CLASSIC,HEDERA,LITECOIN,OPTIMISM,POLYGON,SOLANA,STELLAR,SUI,TEZOS,TONCOIN,XRP,ZORA
```

**Result**: 404 error after authentication (20 networks, 9 unsupported)

### After Fix

```
supportedNetworks=AVALANCHE,BITCOIN,BITCOIN_CASH,DOGECOIN,ETHEREUM,ETHEREUM_CLASSIC,LITECOIN,POLYGON,SOLANA,STELLAR,TEZOS
```

**Result**: Should work correctly (11 networks, all supported)

## Testing Checklist

- [x] TypeScript compiles without errors
- [x] No linter errors in modified files
- [x] URL generation only includes 11 supported networks
- [ ] Authentication flow completes without 404 error (user to test)
- [ ] Robinhood Connect page loads after auth (user to test)
- [ ] Can complete full offramp flow (user to test)

## Expected URL Format

```
https://robinhood.com/connect?applicationId=db2c834a-a740-4dfc-bbaf-06887558185f&offRamp=true&redirectUrl=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A3030%2Fcallback&referenceId=<uuid>&supportedNetworks=AVALANCHE%2CBITCOIN%2CBITCOIN_CASH%2CDOGECOIN%2CETHEREUM%2CETHEREUM_CLASSIC%2CLITECOIN%2CPOLYGON%2CSOLANA%2CSTELLAR%2CTEZOS
```

## Impact on Assets

**Assets Still Supported** (via supported networks):

- All Ethereum ERC-20 tokens (ETH, USDC, USDT, AAVE, LINK, etc.)
- Bitcoin & forks (BTC, BCH, LTC, DOGE)
- Solana & SPL tokens (SOL, BONK, MOODENG)
- Polygon tokens (MATIC)
- Avalanche (AVAX)
- Other L1s (ETC, XTZ, XLM)

**Assets With Addresses But Not in Connect Flow**:

- ARB (Arbitrum) - has address, network not supported
- OP (Optimism) - has address, network not supported
- ZORA - has address, network not supported
- ADA (Cardano) - has address, network not supported
- SUI - has address, network not supported
- HBAR (Hedera) - has address, network not supported
- XRP - has address, network not supported

Note: These assets can still be received if Robinhood adds network support in the future. The deposit addresses are configured and ready.

## Next Steps

1. Test the Connect flow end-to-end
2. Verify no 404 error after authentication
3. Complete a test transaction
4. Monitor for any other issues
5. Contact Robinhood if additional networks need to be added
