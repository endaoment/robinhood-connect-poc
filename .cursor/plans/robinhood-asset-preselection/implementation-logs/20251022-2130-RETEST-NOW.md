# 🔥 CRITICAL FIX - Retest NOW!

## What We Found

You spotted it! The Daffy URL uses a **completely different base URL** than we were using:

- ❌ We used: `https://robinhood.com/us/en/applink/connect/`
- ✅ Daffy uses: `https://robinhood.com/connect/amount`

**Plus** Daffy includes `flow=transfer` and `assetCode` parameters we were missing!

---

## What We Fixed

1. ✅ Changed base URL to `/connect/amount`
2. ✅ Added `flow=transfer` parameter
3. ✅ Added `assetCode` parameter
4. ✅ Reordered parameters to match Daffy exactly

---

## Test It Now! 🚀

```bash
# 1. Restart dev server (IMPORTANT - picks up URL changes)
npm run dev

# 2. Try a small transfer (ETH, SOL, or USDC)
# 3. Watch what happens after you confirm!
```

---

## What Should Happen Now

**After confirming the transfer in Robinhood:**

✅ Browser **redirects back** to our callback page  
✅ You see transfer confirmation  
✅ ngrok inspector shows the callback request  
✅ Console logs show all the parameters Robinhood sent

---

## If It Works

We'll finally see what query parameters Robinhood sends back and can complete Sub-Plan 5! 🎉

---

## Current Generated URL Format

Now matches Daffy **exactly**:

```
https://robinhood.com/connect/amount?
  applicationId=xxx
  &connectId=xxx
  &paymentMethod=crypto_balance
  &redirectUrl=https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok-free.dev/callback
  &supportedAssets=ETH
  &supportedNetworks=ETHEREUM
  &walletAddress=0x...
  &assetCode=ETH
  &flow=transfer
```

**Ready to test!**
