### ⚠️ Deployment Platform Setup

#### Recommended Platform: Vercel

**Why Vercel**:

- Native Next.js support
- Automatic SSL
- Global CDN
- Edge functions
- Environment variable management
- Preview deployments

**Deployment Steps**:

1. **Install Vercel CLI**:

```bash
npm i -g vercel
```

2. **Deploy**:

```bash
cd robinhood-offramp
vercel
```

3. **Configure Environment Variables** (in Vercel dashboard or CLI):

```bash
vercel env add ROBINHOOD_APP_ID production
vercel env add ROBINHOOD_API_KEY production
vercel env add NEXTAUTH_URL production
```

4. **Deploy to Production**:

```bash
vercel --prod
```

#### Alternative Platforms

**AWS Amplify**:

- Configure build settings
- Add environment variables
- Set up custom domain
- Enable HTTPS

**Netlify**:

- Connect GitHub repository
- Configure build command: `npm run build`
- Add environment variables
- Set up custom domain

**Self-Hosted (Docker)**:

- Create `Dockerfile`
- Configure reverse proxy (nginx)
- Set up SSL certificate (Let's Encrypt)
- Configure environment variables

### ✅ Domain & DNS Configuration

- [ ] Production domain purchased/configured
- [ ] DNS A/CNAME records configured
- [ ] SSL certificate issued
- [ ] Domain verified in hosting platform
- [ ] WWW redirect configured (optional)
- [ ] Test domain resolution: `nslookup your-domain.com`

### ⚠️ Database & Storage (Future)

**Current State**: Using localStorage (client-side)

**Production Recommendation**:

- [ ] Set up PostgreSQL or MongoDB
- [ ] Migrate from localStorage to database
- [ ] Configure connection pooling
- [ ] Set up database backups
- [ ] Implement database migrations

**Recommended**: Supabase (PostgreSQL) or MongoDB Atlas

### ⚠️ Rate Limiting & DDoS Protection

**Current**: In-memory rate limiting (development only)

**Production Requirements**:

- [ ] Implement Redis-based rate limiting
- [ ] Configure Cloudflare or similar DDoS protection
- [ ] Set appropriate rate limits per endpoint:
  - URL generation: 10 requests/minute per IP
  - Deposit address redemption: 5 requests/minute per IP
  - Order status: 30 requests/minute per IP
- [ ] Configure rate limit headers (X-RateLimit-\*)

**Recommended Implementation**:

```typescript
// Use Vercel's Rate Limiting (https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/rate-limiting)
// Or implement Redis-based solution:

import Redis from "ioredis";
const redis = new Redis(process.env.REDIS_URL);

async function checkRateLimit(
  identifier: string,
  limit: number,
  window: number
) {
  const key = `ratelimit:${identifier}`;
  const current = await redis.incr(key);

  if (current === 1) {
    await redis.expire(key, window);
  }

  return current <= limit;
}
```

### ✅ Backup & Recovery

- [x] Git repository backed up (GitHub)
- [ ] Environment variables documented securely
- [ ] Database backups configured (N/A for now)
- [ ] Disaster recovery plan documented
- [ ] Rollback procedure documented

**Rollback Procedure**:

1. Identify the last working deployment
2. Revert to previous Git commit or re-deploy previous version
3. Verify environment variables
4. Test critical flows
5. Monitor error rates
